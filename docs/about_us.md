# About Us

### Capgemini Invent combines strategy, technology, data science and creative design to solve the most complex business and technology challenges.

Disruption is not new, but the pace of change is. The fourth industrial revolution is forcing businesses to rethink everything they know.

Leading organizations behave as living entities, constantly adapting to change. With invention at their core, they continuously redesign their business to generate new sources of value. Winning is about fostering inventive thinking to create what comes next.

### Invent. Build. Transform.

This is why we have created Capgemini Invent, Capgeminiâ€™s new digital innovation, consulting and transformation global business line. Our multi-disciplinary team helps business leaders find new sources of value. We accelerate the process of turning ideas into prototypes and scalable real-world solutions; leveraging the full business and technology expertise of the Capgemini Group to implement at speed and scale.

The result is a coordinated approach to transformation, enabling businesses to create the products, services, customer experiences, and business models of the future.
